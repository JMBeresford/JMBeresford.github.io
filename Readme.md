## Terminal Basic

A browser startpage heavily inspired by an original design by kopri@unixhub.net (which can be found [here](https://startpages.github.io/startpages/Startpage_kopri-nb/))

No code was shared between the two. I treated this as a practice exercise. Everything was done from scratch.

## Theming

the following color shchemes are supported
1. Solarized Dark
2. Gruvbox Dark

In order to change the Theme simply uncomment the desired theme's css variables (in main.css) and comment out the currently active theme's css variables.

The css variables are found at the top of main.css

```css
:root{
	/* variables found here */
}
```

## todo

- add music embed
- overhaul styling
- allow switchable themes
- better link organization/addition and deletion
- bookmark search?
- improve search bar
- animations
- add icon

## note:

this was only tested with firefox quantum
