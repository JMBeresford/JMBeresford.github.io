## Terminal Basic

A browser startpage heavily inspired by an original design by kopri@unixhub.net (which can be found [here](https://startpages.github.io/startpages/Startpage_kopri-nb/))

no code was shared between the two. I treated this as a practice exercise. 

##### note:

this was only tested with firefox quantum 63
